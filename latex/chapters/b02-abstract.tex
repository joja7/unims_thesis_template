\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis, we investigate the dynamic behavior of quantum particles in complex environments, focusing particularly on their interaction with condensed matter systems. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and advanced computational simulations, we explore the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. Our study sheds light on fundamental phenomena such as electron transport in nanostructures, the emergence of topological phases in strongly correlated materials, and the dynamics of quantum spin systems. By elucidating these complex phenomena, we contribute to the deeper understanding of quantum matter and pave the way for future advancements in quantum technologies and materials science.
