  Abstract     = {This article discusses the phenomenon of quantum entanglement observed in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and its implications for quantum information processing. The experimental results suggest that BECs can be used as a platform for the creation and manipulation of entangled states, opening up new possibilities for quantum communication and computation.},
